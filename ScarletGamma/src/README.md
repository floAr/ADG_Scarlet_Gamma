2. Documentation
---
* Doxygen comments in the Header at public attributes/methods:

/// \param [in]		if parameter is only read inside method
/// \param [out]	if parameter is only written inside method
/// \param [inout]	the parameter is accessed with read write access
/// \return
```
* Member variables and constants: `///< short comment at the end of the line`
* *.cpp contains standard comments: `// some comment`
